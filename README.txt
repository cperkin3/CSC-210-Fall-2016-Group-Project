Project Description:

The goal of our project is to make a site dedicated to the differences between, and the overlap of, the TV show Game of Thrones and the book series A Song of Ice and Fire. Specifically, we want to have enough basic information that the site is usable to gather information without user content, but have it built so that new user content can easily be added into the site for future users to read and use. Essentially, our goal is to create a wikipedia-like website for the combination of the book series and TV show, combined with a discussion forum for related topics.
